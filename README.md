# Pro-Site
A personal website project under the Gateway Technical College 'Full Stack Web Developer' curriculum.

This site was built with a lot of HTML, some CSS and a tiny bit of JavaScript (that is not the greatest, Lol).

See it here live: https://albee-jay.github.io/Pro-Site/

I built this website following the Gateway Technical College curriclum for the Full Stack Web Developer certificate program.

I need to come back to this to work a lot more on the JavaScript code. All in all, the site works fine and looks great.

I welcome any and all comments or help to make this project better.

Thank You, Albee-Jay
