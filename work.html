          Here you can read all about my work history; even though these are

                I have over 20 years of experience reading cards for people from
                all walks of life; while working with big corporate companies,
                high school seniors, city festivals, psychic fairs and private
                home parties. I love this work because get to help people with
                their concerns and that is a wonderful feeling.

                While I worked with this company for a short time, I learned a
                lot about what it takes to work in a fast paced environment.
                This was an eye opening experience, but in a good way. Lol.
