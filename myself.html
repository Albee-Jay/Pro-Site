        <h2>Who is Albert R Juarez?</h2>
        <p>
          I ask myself this question all the time and the fact that I'm a Gemini
          doesn't make it any easier to come up with a suitable answer.<br />
          So, here's a little bit about me ...
        </p>
        <p>
          I love to laugh, eat, drink and be merry. Comedies (tv or movies) are
          my go-tos when I feel blah and I never say no to tacos, pasta or good
          beer.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not reading cards for my clients or studying to become an IT
          guru, I can be found listening to music: Dead or Alive, Prince, Cher
          and Lady Gaga are some my favorites.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also dig reading, text books are great but I have to be in the mood
          for it, unless I'm studying a certain subject but I tend to lean
          toward vampire fiction, Anne Rice anyone?
        </p>
        <p>
          I can't forget about watching horror movies, it is the absolute best
          and Michael, Jason & Freddy, are my buds.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have a pretty decent sized Batman collection, action figures,
          comic books and artwork.
        </p>
        <p>
          But my most favorite thing ever is going dancing Friday nights at Mad
          Planet in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Oh yeah ... here are 3 things most people don't know about me: I am
          terrified of sharks, but I've never seen one up close (damn you Jaws);
          crayons and coloring books are my safe warm happy place and sometimes
          I am afraid of the dark.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last but not least, my social media outlets are listed below. Some are
          for fun and being silly, some for sharing my interests, and others
          lean toward the business mind; but they all are about the human
          connection and creating meaningful relationships.
        </p>

                I've been on Facebook for a long time and for the most part I
                use it to connect with my family and friends ... and to be
                completely goofy and silly of course!

                I just signed up for LinkedIn in September 2020 at the urging of
                an instructor from my IT class. I really like the way it works,
                it's actually a lot like FB but from a business end. I am
                looking forward to the connection I will make there and learning
                everything I can.

                Instagram is another to place to have fun with friends but here,
                I also get to work with my colleagues from the Tarot world and
                reach out to clients. For both work and play, it serves it's
                purpose.
